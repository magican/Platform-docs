Overview of Intelligent Workload Manager
########################################

SUNFISH Federation provides automated services for joining and leaving the federation, as well as
an interface to the available Federation services for a Service Consumer with ability to request
optimized service list of services matching Consumer requirements better. A common aspect of all
use cases is requirement to be able to retrieve information about the Federation resources and
optionally schedule execution of a workload on a particular service provider. Within SUNFISH, a
component responsible for delivering such functionality is called **Intelligent Workload Manager**
(IWM).

Optimization model applicable to the scenario of Service provisioning by Service Consumer is
offering an improvement over local scheduling while imposing as little as possible of additional
overhead on the definition of the workload requirements. Improvement means achieving a better
outcome regarding user-defined parameters (e.g. cost) while preserving the strict
requirements for the job payload. The goal of the model is to offer an added value over local scope
of resources by finding and managing a globally optimal target for the Service Consumerâ€™s planned
workload.

Optimisation model is a logical component exposed to the user in form of an optional ordering and
filtering capability used during provider lookup request.

IWM is based on open-source Waldur cloud brokerage platform. The latter is extended to include more
fine-grained optimisation capability. The functionality developed within SUNFISH has been integrated
with the upstream.

Instructions for deploying IWM
###############################

IWM functionality has been integrated into Waldur. As such, deployment of IWM is done in the same
fashion as upstream. Installation script is below. Deployment requirements are:

- CentOS 7 or other RHEL7-compliant operating system
- At least 8GB of RAM, preferably 2 cores or more.

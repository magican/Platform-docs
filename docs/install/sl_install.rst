Usage Guide
=============

The Invoke API is a general-purpose invocation of a chaincode, hence the following parameters are expected: 

*	Chaincode: the name of the chaincode to invoke.
*	Function: the name of the function of the chaincode to invoke. 
*	Argument: the arguments to give in input to the function.

Therefore, this API has been implemented to realise the monitoring functionality of the chaincode and, most of all, for the remaining number of chaincode part of the federation; namely anonymisation, key value store and the smart contract used for the Use Case 1.

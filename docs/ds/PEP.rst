SUNFISH Policy Enforcement Point (PEP) API
==========================================

The interactions executed inside one zone are checked by and enforced in
the scope of a PEP assigned for that zone. The approach is similar for
the zones that consist of geographically dispersed locations: each PEP
(or sub-PEP) is responsible for its geographical unit or layer. Being
the single point of contact of a zone, the PEP is primarily responsible
for checking incoming and outgoing requests. In the second instance,
depending on security settings and application requirements, PEP might
serve as an inter-zone communication gateway, as well.

**Version:** 1.0.0

*POST*
''''''''''

**Summary:** This endpoint is used by PEPs to POST new requests to other
PEPs. Inputs to this endpoint are contextual parameters that establish
the request, application and target specific settings. The response of
this action is the data record that contains request id and data
structure describing status parameters or other PEP requirements.

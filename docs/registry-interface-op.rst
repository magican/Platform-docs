Registry Interface 
####################

The Registry Interface (RI) is the logical component that manages the storing and retrieval operations directed to the blockchain based registry. 

The RI offers a set of APIs that the different components, if authorised, can invoke to store or retrieve data from the blockchain-empowered registry. The specifications of the APIs can be found at: https://github.com/sunfish-prj/SUNFISH-Platform-API

RI, thus, is a central component of the SUNFISH insfrastructure. Other respectice SUNFISH components need to leverage the RI to store and update corresponding data by invoking the defined endpoints of the APIs.
